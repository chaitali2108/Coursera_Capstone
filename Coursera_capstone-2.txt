Predictive Model for Road Traffic Accident Severity
Data Section:
    The dataset used in building this model contains all kinds of collisions in Seattle from 2004 to 2020. The damage level of road accidents is predicted by the indicator 'SEVERITUCODE' which is chosen as the dependent variable. The degree of collision rises from property damage, injury, serious injury finally to fatality. Among dozens of attributes, this project concentrates on both natural and human factors which may lead to car accidents. Natural factors include 'WEATHER','ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND' which represents weather, road and view circumstance respectively. On the other hand, human factors usually includes status of drivers such as 'INATTENTIONIND','UNDERINFL', and 'SPEEDING' which shows the concentration of drivers mind, coordination, drug or alcohol influence and overspeed.
