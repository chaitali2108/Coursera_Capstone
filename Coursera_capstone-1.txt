Predictive Model for Road Accident Severity
1.Introduction:
Road accidents have become a major reason of mortality among many countries in the world which also has a negative psychological as well as economical impact on society. The deaths and injuries from traffic accidents are now the world phenomenon. Citizens feel lack of security when they drive on roads, cross the street or even walk along the foothpaths. Vehicle manufactures have invested large amount of professionals and fundings to increase the quality of vehicles but all these efforts have less contribution to traffic rushes. It is the time for government to make strict rules in this sector and also should devise some plans to take actions in order to gain control on road accidents. Seattle Department of Transportation provides traffic accident cases from 2004 for almost 15 years to discover the reasons behind these collisions.
2.Business Problem:
The goal of this model is the analysis of the collision dataset of the city of Seattle, to find patterns, relationships and determine features such as weather conditions, road and traffic conditions,light and alcohol influence on driver, driver inattention to provide the best road traffic accident severity prediction. It will use some analytical techniques and machine learning classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree analysis, k-nearest-neighbors, support vector machine,etc.
3.Beneficiaries:
This model can mainly help transportational sector. Using this model Governments can improve traffic policies or update public facilities such as street lamp,  speed bumps at proper positions. Car rental or insurance companies are also among the target groups of this analysis because they can classify potentical customers and design different services deliverable based on customers driving habits and other conditions
